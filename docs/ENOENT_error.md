# ENOENT Error in Next.js (.next directory)

## Error Example
```
ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/path/to/project/.next/server/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/[__metadata_id__]/route/app-paths-manifest.json'
```

## What it Means
- This error means that Next.js is looking for a build artifact that does not exist in your `.next` directory.
- It is usually harmless during development, but can cause issues if the build is incomplete or corrupted.

## How to Fix
1. **Clean the build artifacts:**
   ```sh
   rm -rf .next
   ```
2. **Rebuild the project:**
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

This will regenerate all necessary files and resolve the missing file errors.

---

If you see this error repeatedly, make sure your build process completes without interruption and that you are not running multiple conflicting dev servers.
